# Shopping Cart Project

This is a project I procrastinated on, my main issue was how did I want to style it? How did I want it to look.
I am still not happy with the end results, specifically with the item containers. I wanted to add a pop-up with more information of each item when clicked. 

This was my first project that uses Tailwindcss. I was expecting to have trouble getting used to classNames having all the info but it was a lot easier than I expected.

This is the final project for the react section in The Odin project's JavaScript path.
I still need to work on step 6 which I will come back and work on.
"Display an input field on it, which lets a user manually type in how many items they want to buy. Also, add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tuning."
